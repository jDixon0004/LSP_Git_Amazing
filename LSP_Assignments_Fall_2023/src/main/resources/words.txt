This assignment gives you some experience with, and insight into, how some of the ideas covered in this course apply in more “real-world” settings. In particular, this exercise gives you a problem to solve, but leaves you to use your own judgement about the algorithms or data structures to use — much as a professional software developer relies on their own judgement.
